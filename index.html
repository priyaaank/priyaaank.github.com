    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>I am a developer who can come across as little opinionated and crazy. But I'd like to think that you'd be able to see the passion in my craziness. I am very passionate about technology and I believe in contributing back to developer community to grow ouselves better as a community. I am up for anything challanging that piques my interest.</p>

    <h3>Achievements</h3>

    <h6><u>Mobile apps for a prominent US Airline</u></h6>

      Contributed to development of mobile apps across platforms like Android, iOS, Mobile Web and Blackberry 10. As part of my tenure of the project, I helped apps on android, iOS and web mature with an inhouse platform <a href="http://calatrava.github.com">Calatrava</a>.
